## 🎯 What Does This Thing Do?

Lead Tracker is a sleek Chrome extension that turns you into a URL-hoarding ninja! Whether you're researching, shopping, or just procrastinating productively, this little green machine keeps track of all your important links.

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Smile

### 🔗 **Save Current Tab**

Click "Save tab" and BAM! The current page URL gets added to your collection faster than you can say "bookmarks are so last decade."

### ⌨️ **Manual URL Entry**

Type any URL into the input field and hit "Save Input" - perfect for those links your friend texted you at 2 AM.

### 🗑️ **Nuclear Option**

Double-click "Delete All" to wipe your entire collection clean. It's like Marie Kondo for your URLs - sometimes you just need a fresh start!

### 💾 **Persistent Storage**

Your links stick around even after closing Chrome, thanks to localStorage magic. No cloud, no fuss, just local goodness.
